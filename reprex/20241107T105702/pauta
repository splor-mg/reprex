"So how do we incorporate two or more fact tables into one data model and treat them as two separate logical tables while, at the same time, avoiding the synthetic key issue? At first sight, it can seem like both options are mutually exclusive, but there is a workaround which is to create a Link Table. As its name implies, a link table essentially 'links' two or more fact tables by taking all common fields out of the original tables and placing them into a new one (the link table). The new link table contains all possible combination of values for that set of fields and, through a unique key, is associated to the original tables."

"Sometimes we are faced with a situation where things are not quite easy. There may be multiple fact tables with multiple associations to other tables that cause the 'dreaded' synthetic key."

"Probably, the most common situation that requires more complex data modeling is where we have more than one fact table—a table containing a number that we might use in a calculation—all of which have several common key fields linking to other dimension tables. There are several ways to deal with this situation; by far the easiest way is to simply concatenate the fact tables together to form one large fact table."
